# NEAR Nodes

NEAR Protocol runs on a collection of publicly maintained computers (or "nodes"). All nodes are running the same `nearcore` codebase with the latest releases available on [GitHub](https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases/).

It is important to keep in mind all nodes run the same codebase, with different configurations. As such, we have split up the documentation for running different types of node into sections specific to the node's type.

| Node Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Validator Node](/validator)   | Validator nodes participate in the consensus and produce blocks and/or chunks.          |
| [RPC Node](/rpc)               | RPC nodes are service providers that provide public RPC endpoints for developers to use.           |
| [Archival Node](/archival)     | Archival nodes store full blockchain data, and build an archive of historical states.           |
